# SQLObject

SQLObject is an object-relational mapper, i.e., a library that will wrap
your database tables in Python classes, and your rows in Python
instances.

It currently supports MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite; connections to other
backends - Firebird, Sybase, MSSQL and MaxDB (also known as SAPDB) - are
lesser debugged).

Python 2.7 or 3.4+ is required.
